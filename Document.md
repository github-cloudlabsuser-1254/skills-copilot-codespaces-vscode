# Sample Node.js Application

This document provides an overview of a sample Node.js application, including its architecture and workflow. The application is designed to demonstrate the use of Node.js for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.

---

## Application Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the Node.js application:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Client -->|HTTP Request| API[Node.js API Server]
    API -->|Database Query| DB[(Database)]
    API -->|External API Call| ExternalAPI[Third-Party API]
    DB -->|Response| API
    ExternalAPI -->|Response| API
    API -->|HTTP Response| Client
```

## Workflow

The workflow of the application is depicted below:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server as Node.js Server
    participant Database
    participant ExternalAPI as Third-Party API

    Client->>Server: Send HTTP Request
    Server->>Database: Query Data
    Database-->>Server: Return Data
    Server->>ExternalAPI: Fetch Additional Data
    ExternalAPI-->>Server: Return Data
    Server->>Client: Send HTTP Response
```

---

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Built using Express.js for handling HTTP requests.
- **Database Integration**: Supports MongoDB for data storage.
- **Third-Party API Integration**: Fetches additional data from external APIs.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.
